👨‍🎓 I'm a computer engineering student.

😍I'm currently studying the Full Stack development area, where I'm learning HTML, CSS, Javascript,Java, C# and React.I also study data engineering, as I am a person open to new technologies.

🧑🏾‍💼At the moment I am open to new opportunities.

🧙🏽My biggest hobby is reading fantasy books: "***One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them***"
